Description: Provides a shiny-based front end (the 'ExPanD' app) and
    a set of functions for exploratory data analysis. Run as a web-based 
    app, 'ExPanD' enables users to assess the robustness of empirical evidence 
    without providing them access to the underlying data. You can export a 
    notebook containing the analysis of 'ExPanD' and/or use the functions of the 
    package to support your exploratory data analysis workflow. Refer to the 
    vignettes of the package for more information on how to use 'ExPanD' and/or 
    the functions of this package.
